The project's current printed circuit layout and placement scheme intended to be printed in scale 1:1.

The prototype was made with these PDFs utilizing the "toner direct method". Take care to get the correct version (mirror) as the printed side of the sheet always needs to be the side facing towards the surface with this method.

In addition you will find some oscillograms showing typical electrical signals of that very special UART-protocol.
