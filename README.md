Infrared and Serial Interface for certain Swiss-made Coffeemakers

This hardware and software is intended to read and control some coffeemakers of that well known Swiss brand (and some others) which make use of an infrared coupled diagnostic port. The same circuit can read out direct coupled (plugged-in) machines as well as long as they use the same TTL-based/5V UART protocol and physical pin-assigment. If the four-pin header doesn't fit your machine, maybe you find the appropriate pin-assignment of other machines and can make a simple adaptor of the relevant signals RXD, TXD and GND.
